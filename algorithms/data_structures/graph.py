Graph Data Structure

A graph data structure consists of a finite (and possibly mutable)
set of vertices or nodes or points,
together with a set of unordered pairs of these vertices
for an undirected graph or a set of
ordered pairs for a directed graph. These pairs are known as edges, arcs,
or lines for an undirected graph and as arrows, directed edges, directed arcs,
or directed lines for a directed graph.
The vertices may be part of the graph structure,
or may be external entities represented by integer indices or references.
